Mancopter Concept:
-You're 5 dudes, 4 of them are the rotors of a makeshift helicopter, 1 of them is sitting in the cockpit
-The 4 rotor mans all move in a circular shape
-The mancopter is so heavy that it can't move around on the ground
-All it can do at the starts is: 
	1. Jump (in which it can move slightly to the side), and
	2. Hover downwards slowly with the boys' help
-The first few levels will force the player to get used to these 2 mechanics
-Eventually, they will learn a third: 
	3. Fall quickly downwards (in which they can move slightly to the side)
-This ability will come in useful when up against enemies that will focus a lazer on the player, and attempt
to snipe them instantaneously (or when some other object is about to hit them
-In can also come in useful if the player is trying to quickly complete a level (levels are timed)
-after a little while, the player will learn a skill that will allow them to defeat enemies:
	4. The ability to throw objects at enemies
-The player will be given access to a variety of different objects, each with varying attributes 
-For example, a chicken weighs little, while a hardball weighs a lot, but does more damage, and a knife
is thrown vertically, while a grenade loops downwards, a boomerang returns to the player, etc.
-After a period of time, the player will be able to 
	5. do a double jump in mid-air, granting them some more leeway
-The player will also be given access to:
	6. the ability to rapidly spin in the air for a half second, which makes them destroy any enemy in
	its vicinity, but causes the player to instantaneously fall


-The player will eventually be able to start acquiring new mans, Pokemon-style, which they can swap into
the copter, giving it new, varying abilities (their data will be stored in a device called a "Mandex"
-All the people in the game have "man" as part of their name (coleman, moleman, badman, the first man 
basically adam with a fig leaf in front of his crotch, a portguese man-o-war, anything with man)
-Portugese Man Of War (a portugese Soldier), 
-All the mans will have a description, and a list of their abilities (weight, throwing strength, etc.)
-The person in the cockpit has various functions:
	1. He controls how quickly the player falls, if he's heavy, the helicopter will fall quickly, if he's
	light, the helicopter will fall more slowly
	2. He controlsthe strength at which the object is thrown
-The rotor mans:
	1. each have their own strength rating, which determines how quickly they will die when hit by enemies
	2. Their weight also contributes to how quickly they will fall
	3. However, their mass will also make them fall more slowly (so a very wide, but not fat person
	will make them fall slowly)
	4. 

Misc Ideas:
-after a certain point in the game, the player will be able to unlock nightmare versions of stages, with
more powerful enemies, and certain restrictions, such as only being allowed 2 mans at the start
-Fallout 3-style, the player should feel constantly rewarded for their actions with punchy sound effects.
-When they touch down on the ground, they should hear a punchy sound effect
-The player's score on a level is dependent on the time it took them to complete it, the amount of times
they touched a surface (less is better), and the amount of hits they took
-TWO PLAYER MODE: player 1 controls the man in the cockpit (who does the liftoff jump and throws stuff),
player 2 controlls the rotor mans, who control the direction and speed at which the mancopter falls in the air
-Great multiplayer game for the Switch!
-The player loses a score multiplier if they don't touch the ground for too long (when they touch the ground,
a timer will start, if it eclipses 1 minute, the player must start over
